* jp_lwt - Learning With Texts, fine-tuned for Japanese
  Heavily influenced by [[http://www.sdkrashen.com/][Dr. Stephen Krashen's theories on second language acquisition]], [[https://www.lingq.com/][Steve Kaufmann's LingQ]] and its [[http://lwt.sourceforge.net/][free, open-source equivalent Learning With Texts]]; jp_lwt aims to help japanese learners by essentially cutting down the time it takes to look up words in a dictionnary, allowing them to read more in the same amount of time, thus speeding up the speed they reach a critical mass of input.

* Rationale
  LingQ's Japanese community was active and there were accurate definitions for essentially every word, however the japanese parsing was subpar (using regular expressions instead of something like MeCab) at the time I was using it, making it uncomfortable to use at times.

  Learning With Text also used regular expressions for parsing, with the added qualm of having to manually create every entry (looking it up on a dictionnary, copy pasting the definition etc...), which made it practically unusable as far as Japanese is concerned.

  Please note the use of past tense, the initial version and rationale are based off of my experience from nearly 3 years ago, if the information is wrong nowadays, please do post an issue so I can fix my mistake ASAP, I do not wish to prejudice those two great software and encourage you to check them out if you are learning a different language as they will likely work flawlessly for you.

* Motivation
  jp_lwt was almost a "landmark" project for me that served as a good refresher course on MVC (although the Controller became Template) as well as a mean to learn Django, JavaScript and jQuery. However, as a CS student, I made tremendous progress in the last few years and wanted to revisit this project, starting afresh in order to learn new technologies.

  This is why my experience and opinions on LWT/LingQ might be wrong now.
